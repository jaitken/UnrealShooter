# UnrealShooter

First attempt at a game using Unreal Engine/C++

Goal is to create 3rd person shooter that plays similarly to Halo Reach's Firefight or Call Of Duty's Nazi Zombie mode

Used an online class/tutorial to learn the basics of unreal engine and have continued to build on it. Class I used can be found here https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealengine-cpp/
